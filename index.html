						quickly became a prominent figure in the racing world and went on to found Scuderia Ferrari in
						1929, which served as Alfa Romeo's racing division. In 1947, Ferrari launched his own car
						company, which he named Ferrari S.p.A. The company's first car was the Ferrari 125 S, which was
						powered by a 1.5-liter V12 engine. Ferrari's cars quickly gained a reputation for their speed

					<h7>Enzo Ferrari established Scuderia Ferrari in 1929 and began producing his own cars in 1947. The Ferrari 125 S was his first car, a racing car with a 1.5-liter V12 engine that produced 118 horsepower. The car was successful in its debut race, the 1947 Rome Grand Prix. Ferrari also produced road cars, such as the Ferrari 166 Inter in 1948. It had a 2.0-liter V12 engine that produced 110 horsepower and was known for its luxurious interior and beautiful styling. The Ferrari 166 MM was a racing car produced in the same year with a 2.0-liter V12 engine that produced 140 horsepower. It was successful in endurance races, including the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans.

It's beautiful design as well as it's luxury interior would make it a grand success with the rich and celebrities. One of Enzo Ferrari's last projects the Ferraro 375 MM was a racing car produced in 1953 with a 4.5-liter V12 engine that produced 340 horsepower. The car was successful in endurance races, including the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 375 MM was one of the most powerful racing cars of its time and is still considered a classic today.</h7>

            <h7>Enzo Ferrari's aggressive and eye-catching design is my favorite when it comes to cars. The sleek design of his cars allowed them to be both beautiful and efficent reducing the drag on the car, thus making it faster and sharper. My favorite model of Ferrari is the Ferrari Enzo. This model although not designed by Enzo himself represents his lasting impact on the automotive industry and the evolution of car technology. The Enzo features a 6.0-liter V12 engine that produces 651 horsepower and 485 lb-ft of torque. This powerplant was mated to a six-speed sequential gearbox that delivers lightning-fast shifts and helps the Enzo accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds. Top speed being a blistering 217 mph.</h7>
